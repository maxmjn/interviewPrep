SQL

First, read a csv file `people.csv` representing a database table, `people`.
Then output the answers to the following SQL queries:

  1. select round(avg(age), 1) from people
     (overall average age, rounded to 1 decimal place)

  2. select state, count(*) from people group by state order by count(*) desc
     (number of people in each state, ordered most to least)

  3. select state, round(avg(age), 0) from people group by state order by avg(age)
     (average age per state, ordered smallest to largest average)

  4. select state, round(avg(age), 0) from people where age > 15 AND age < 55 group by state order by state
     (average age per state for people between 15 and 55 years old, ordered by state name)

Output a blank line after each question so the output of your solution is formatted the same
as the contents of `output.txt`.
