Binary Tree

The task is to build a binary tree using a breadth first insertion method, and
then print out a depth first traversal of the values.

  1. Read in the comma delimited file `input.txt`. We will use these values to
     construct the binary tree.

  2. Build a binary tree using a breadth first insertion method. Your complete
     tree should look like this...


                                    1
                            --------|--------
                            |               |
                            2               3
                        ----|----       ----|----
                        |       |       |       |
                        4       5       6       7
                      --|--   --|--   --|--   --|--
                      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
                      8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15


  3. Perform a depth first traversal of the tree printing out one value per
     line.

The output of your solution should match the contents of `output.txt`.
